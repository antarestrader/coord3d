This is a very basic coordinate library that understands the standard
3-dimentional coordinate system with x,y,z components.  It is not as
powerful or versitile as a rtue Vector implimentation but is optimixed
instead to be able to write 3d code efficiently.

Note that this code is not fast.  If you have need of faster code please
find a c/java implimentation of a mathamatics library.
